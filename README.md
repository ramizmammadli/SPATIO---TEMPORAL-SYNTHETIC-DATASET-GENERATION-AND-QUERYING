# SPATIO---TEMPORAL-SYNTHETIC-DATASET-GENERATION-AND-QUERYING
  In this study, a certain number of streets were
randomly selected on the raw Istanbul road map and recorded
as a separate layer. On these streets, points were produced
every 40 meters and time stamps were assigned to these points.
The points represent the trajectory of the vehicles advancing
on the street. Time stamps are assigned to the generated
points, taking into account the speed of the vehicle and the
sharp turns of the streets. This synthetic dataset generated was
made 3-dimensional time-spatial and indexed with 3 different
methods. The query performance of these indexing methods
was compared and the benefits were observed compared to
non-indexed data.
